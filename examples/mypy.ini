# Mypy configuration for examples/
#
# This configuration provides enhanced type checking for example code while
# maintaining practical type safety standards.
#
# Philosophy:
# - Examples should demonstrate best practices
# - Type stubs help with third-party libraries (threading.local)
# - Strict mode enabled to catch real bugs
#
# Usage:
#   cd examples && mypy .
#   OR from project root: mypy examples/

[mypy]
# Use strict type checking for examples (demonstrate best practices)

# Python version
python_version = 3.13

# Local type stubs for threading.local() enhancement
